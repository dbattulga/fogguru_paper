In this work, we introduce and demonstrate FogGuru, a platform for developing and deploying fog applications and services based on the stream processing approach. FogGuru was designed to enable applications developers to program fog nodes easily; it is based on a set of open source components implementing open standards. We provide instructions for developers to quickly build and deploy FogGuru on single Raspberry Pis or a cluster thereof (using in the latter case Docker Swarm for orchestrating the deployment).
% This paper presents the design and implementation of a Fog platform based on Apache Flink.
% The re-tasking approach is designed to enhance programmability of Fog platform, taking into account the specifications of application developers.
The demonstration implements a traffic data analytics scenario based on real-world data from 245,369 Internet-connected vehicles. The practical experiments show that the FogGuru prototypical implementation can process in near-time fast data streams from IoT devices.

Future work includes the robust and fault-tolerant deployment of the platform,
integrate autoscaling methods, further devise solutions to automate such
deployments and their continuous optimization, and a more thorough evaluation of
the performance attainable.
