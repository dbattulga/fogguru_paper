Fog computing infrastructure aims to offload computing resources from cloud providers by placing edge devices closer to end-users and/or data sources. Systems and methods for developing and deploying an application in Fog nodes are still in their infancy. In this work, we present FogGuru, a fog computing platform meant to facilitate application deployment in Fog environments. FogGuru builds upon the stream processing paradigm for fog applications design; its implementation makes use of the open-source Apache Flink stream processing engine. The demo will showcase a Fog-based traffic analytics application deployed using FogGuru and running on a fog node, composed of a cluster of five Raspberry Pis.
 % (SPE) . SPEs are well suited in Fog computing platform based on their extensive features. The proposed platform was implemented using container orchestration and demonstrated on a cluster of resource-constrained devices.
